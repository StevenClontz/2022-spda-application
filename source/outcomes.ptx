  <title>Summary of Anticipated Outcomes</title>
  <p>
To conclude, summer salary support will provide Clontz time to
develop free and open-source software to support dozens of instructors
that currently use these tools, as well as carefully prepare
a new NSF proposal that will provide ongoing support of this software
development, disseminate their use in the classroom to even more
isntructors, and enable formal evaluation of these projects' efficacy in
the undergraduate mathematics classroom.
