<p>The work described above is well-aligned with the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Education and Human Resources <a class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/biblio-iuse.html" title="Bibliographic Entry 20: Improving Undergraduate STEM Education: Education and Human Resources (IUSE: EHR)">[20]</a> NSF solicitation. Clontz is currently funded as part of an IUSE program on Team-Based Inquiry Learning, and served as a consultant for another IUSE program studying the use of open-source textbooks in undergraduate mathematics education, particularly those authored in PreTeXt. With the college's support, Clontz will have the bandwidth to submit a new IUSE proposal focusing on the cyberinfrastructure needs of these projects and related RUME work.</p>
