        <p>
NSF's Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) <q>supports and coordinates the development,
acquisition, and provision of state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure resources, tools and services
essential to the advancement and transformation of science and engineering</q>. In service of this
mission, Dr. Clontz serves as co-PI on NSF DUE Award 2011807 <xref ref="biblio-tbil-award"/>,
responsible for the development of several open-source technologies to support evidence-based pedagogies in
undergraduate mathematics education.
        </p>
        <p>
This proposal requests to leverage the momentum from these projects by allowing Clontz to extend
his current NSF support of one month in 2022 Summer to spend the full summer developing these
technologies, as well as prepare a new NSF grant proposal as Principal Investigator specifically
dedicated to developing and evaluating these technologies for use in the undergraduate mathematics classroom.
