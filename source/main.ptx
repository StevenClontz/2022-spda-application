        <p>
NSF's Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (OAC) <q>supports and coordinates the development,
acquisition, and provision of state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure resources, tools and services
essential to the advancement and transformation of science and engineering</q>. In service of this
mission, Dr. Clontz serves as co-PI on NSF DUE Award 2011807 <xref ref="biblio-tbil-award"/>,
responsible for the development of classroom materials relying on several open-source technologies
built to support evidence-based pedagogies in undergraduate mathematics education.
        </p>
        <p>
This proposal requests to leverage the momentum from this project by allowing Clontz to extend
his current NSF support to spend the full Summer 2022 term developing these
technologies themselves, as well as prepare his first NSF grant proposal as Principal Investigator specifically 
dedicated to developing and evaluating these technologies for use in the undergraduate mathematics classroom.
